# Student Report Card Generator

> A small vanilla JavaScript project I built to practice DOM manipulation, user input validation, and dynamic UI updates â€” it creates a student report card based on subjects and marks entered by the user.

---

## What it does

With this tool, I can:
- Enter a studentâ€™s name, grade, subjects, and marks.
- Validate that the number of subjects matches the number of marks.
- Automatically capitalize subject names for clean display.
- Calculate the average mark.
- Display a dynamic pass/fail message with color feedback based on performance.
- Show all details (name, grade, subjects, marks, average, and pass/fail status) in a styled report card area.

Everything is done entirely in JavaScript, manipulating the DOM and handling user input live in the browser.

## Code overview

The core logic is inside `script.js`, which:
- Reads values from form inputs (name, grade, subjects, marks).
- Splits and formats subject names and marks.
- Checks that inputs are complete and valid.
- Calculates the total average and updates the report card display.
- Dynamically changes heading messages and color based on the result.
